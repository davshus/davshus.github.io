I'm a senior at Princeton University studying Computer Science and Physics. I'm incredibly lucky to be advised by Professors <a href='https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zhonge/'>Ellen Zhong</a> and <a href='https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fheide/'>Felix Heide</a>.

I'm interested in using computers to understand the world. In the past I have spent time on <a href='https://www.skydio.com/'>autonomous</a> <a href='https://www.nuro.ai/'>vehicles</a>, <a href='https://light.princeton.edu/'>neural scene representations</a>, and <a href='https://ezlab.princeton.edu/'>machine learning for structural biology</a>.

You can reach me at `A@B.edu`, where `A, B = dshustin, princeton`.
